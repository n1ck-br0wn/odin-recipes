    <p>Watch out <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/top-little-debbie-treats-taste-test-8425274">Little Debbie</a>—this copycat recipe for Cosmic Brownies is a dead ringer for (if not better than) the original treat. Our recipe tester went as far as to call them "the most perfect brownie ever" thanks to the combination of a chewy and fudgy brownie, topped with a melt-in-your-mouth ganache, and crunchy sprinkles. This dessert will transport you back to childhood.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Brownies: Preheat the oven to <b>350F</b> <i>(175C)</i>. Line a 13- x 9-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on short sides. Coat foil and sides of pan with baking spray; set aside.</li>
        <li>Microwave chocolate and butter in a large microwavable bowl on high, stirring in 30 second intervals, until fully melted and smooth, about 2 minutes total. Whisk in cocoa, canola oil, and vanilla until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Whisk sugar and brown sugar into chocolate mixture until combined. Add eggs, 1 at a time, whisking until smooth and combined after each addition, about 2 minutes total. Gently fold in flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking powder until just combined, making sure not to overmix the batter, about 45 seconds.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared baking pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until set and a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, 55 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest in pan on a wire rack until room temperature, about 1 hour. Once at room temperature, cover, and place in refrigerator; chill completely, at least 1 more hour.</li>
        <li>When brownie has chilled, prepare the Ganache: Place chocolate in a medium mixing bowl; set aside. Bring heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high, stirring occasionally. Pour heavy cream over chopped chocolate; whisk until chocolate is fully melted, about 45 seconds. Whisk in butter and salt until smooth and shiny; set aside.</li>
        <li>Invert cooled Brownie onto a large cutting board and discard aluminum foil. Using a serrated knife, trim and discard outer edges, about 1/4-inch on all sides. Using an offset spatula, spread Ganache in an even layer over top of brownie. Sprinkle evenly with rainbow candy-coated chocolates. Chill Brownie, uncovered, until Ganache is mostly set, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut Brownie into 12 even (4- x 2-inch) pieces. Using the back of the knife, make an indent going crosswise along center of each brownie.</li>
    </ol>
